neater. Below links are the menu guide that will be on each page. They link to my other created html pages in

<!-- h2 is the next header size, this is a general homepage. I have images pulled from some of my art websites.
I used the center option throughout to help with my desired style. I played with image size a little dependering on where
the photo was placed. -->
