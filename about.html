        <h2><center>Here's to New Beginnings!</center></h2>
    <p><center>Just like us, our page is a work in progress. There are so many amazing artists and creators in the world today, so it can be intimidating to know how to put yourself out there. <br>
    This adventurs began during the initial days of the pandemic with acrylic paint on canvas. We also learned out how create digital artwork for printing on everything from posters to face masks to mugs and t-shirts. <br>
While there have been many stumbles along the way, there has also been some excitement and a little growth. The main thing is to just keep moving forward and learning what brings joy.</center></p>


    <h2><center>Our Mission</center></h2>
    <p><center>While we want to create and inspire with our pieces, we ultimately want to help promote conservation and sustainability practices and eductaion. <br>
    As many are aware, our planet is suffering from the effects of human actions. This not only impacts the climate, natural resources, plants and animals, but ourselves and future generations <br>
There are a number of knowledgable resources to follow and support to learn more about the issues and to help stop or reverse some of the negative impacts. <br>
My main focus is the help support animal conservation groups. For each of the items sold on my website I will donate 10% to the noted group. This is a small way we can all help out the people on the front lines.<br>
If you want to donate directly to an organization, more information can be found on Action tab above. Thank you again for your support!</center></p>
